# 0x0B Python Input/Output

This repository contains Python scripts that cover various aspects of input/output operations in Python. Each script corresponds to a specific task or functionality related to file handling, JSON serialization, and object manipulation.

## Files

Here's a list of the files in this repository:

- `0-read_file.py`: Script to read and print the content of a text file.
- `1-write_file.py`: Script to write a string to a text file and return the number of characters written.
- `2-append_write.py`: Script to append a string to the end of a text file and return the number of characters added.
- `3-to_json_string.py`: Script to convert an object to its JSON representation as a string.
- `4-from_json_string.py`: Script to convert a JSON string to a Python object.
- `5-save_to_json_file.py`: Script to save an object to a JSON file.
- `6-load_from_json_file.py`: Script to load an object from a JSON file.
- `7-add_item.py`: Script to add arguments to a Python list and save them to a file.
- `8-class_to_json.py`: Script to convert an object to a dictionary description for JSON serialization.
- `9-student.py`: Script containing a class `Student` definition with methods for JSON serialization.
- `10-student.py`: Script containing a class `Student` definition with methods for JSON serialization and filtering attributes.
- `11-student.py`: Script containing a class `Student` definition with methods for JSON serialization, loading from JSON, and reloading attributes.
- `12-pascal_triangle.py`: Script to generate Pascal's triangle as a list of lists of integers.

## Usage

Each script can be run directly from the command line. For example:

```bash
./0-read_file.py my_file.txt
```

Replace `my_file.txt` with the path to the file you want to operate on.

## Testing

No test cases are provided for these scripts. However, each script can be manually tested by running it with appropriate inputs and verifying the output.
