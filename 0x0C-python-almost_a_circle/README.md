## Description

The project involves the creation of a base class `Base` and two derived classes `Rectangle` and `Square`. Various attributes and methods are implemented to perform different operations on instances of these classes, such as calculating area, displaying information, updating attributes, and saving/loading objects to/from JSON files.

## Tasks

Each file corresponds to a specific task or functionality within the project. Tasks include implementing initialization, setter and getter methods, updating attributes, calculating area, displaying information, and more.

## Usage

To test the functionalities of different tasks, execute the corresponding `main.py` files. For example, to test Task 0, run:

```bash
python 0-main.py
Similarly, replace `0` with the task number to test other functionalities.
```
