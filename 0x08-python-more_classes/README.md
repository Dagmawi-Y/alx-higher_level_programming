# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

## Description
This directory contains Python scripts and classes demonstrating concepts related to object-oriented programming in Python, particularly focusing on classes and objects.

## Files
* `0-rectangle.py`: Empty Python class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
* `1-rectangle.py`: Python class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with private instance attributes `width` and `height`, and instantiation with optional width and height.
* `2-rectangle.py`: Python class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with private instance attributes `width` and `height`, instantiation with optional width and height, and public instance methods `area()` and `perimeter()`.
* `3-rectangle.py`: Python class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with private instance attributes `width` and `height`, instantiation with optional width and height, public instance methods `area()` and `perimeter()`, and a string representation method.
* `4-rectangle.py`: Python class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with private instance attributes `width` and `height`, instantiation with optional width and height, public instance methods `area()` and `perimeter()`, a string representation method, and a representation method for use with `eval()`.
* `5-rectangle.py`: Python class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with private instance attributes `width` and `height`, instantiation with optional width and height, public instance methods `area()` and `perimeter()`, a string representation method, a representation method for use with `eval()`, and a method to detect instance deletion.
* `6-rectangle.py`: Python class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with private instance attributes `width` and `height`, instantiation with optional width and height, public instance methods `area()` and `perimeter()`, a string representation method, a representation method for use with `eval()`, a method to detect instance deletion, and a class attribute to count instances.
* `7-rectangle.py`: Python class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with private instance attributes `width` and `height`, instantiation with optional width and height, public instance methods `area()` and `perimeter()`, a string representation method, a representation method for use with `eval()`, a method to detect instance deletion, a class attribute to count instances, and a class attribute to set print symbol.
* `8-rectangle.py`: Python class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with private instance attributes `width` and `height`, instantiation with optional width and height, public instance methods `area()` and `perimeter()`, a string representation method, a representation method for use with `eval()`, a method to detect instance deletion, a class attribute to count instances, a class attribute to set print symbol, and a static method to compare rectangles.
* `9-rectangle.py`: Python class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with private instance attributes `width` and `height`, instantiation with optional width and height, public instance methods `area()` and `perimeter()`, a string representation method, a representation method for use with `eval()`, a method to detect instance deletion, a class attribute to count instances, a class attribute to set print symbol, a static method to compare rectangles, and a class method to create a square.
